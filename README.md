# snake-game

This is a version of the snake game that I programmed last year with JavaScript in my Applied Computer Science course. It also uses HTML to set up the window formatting.

Note: Must click inside of the canvas in order to get working arrow keys. If not, the Event Listener will not read a key.

Credits to:

w3schools for sound function, which allows a sound (.wav file in this case) to be played in the game.
